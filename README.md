Instant messaging for the BBC micro:bit

I got my hands on some cool little devices called the BBC micro:bit, they're little PCBs that allow you to make programs for them with block code(ew), JavaScript or Python.

Which brings us to HatIM, a neat program that allows instant messaging using the built in radio functionality. Basically a walkie-talkie but for geeks.

This is compatible with both the V1 and V2 model, but if you have a V2 you get notification sounds.

# Setup
To setup, connect your micro:bit to your computer via USB. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/Colonial-Coders/HatIM/releases) and copy it to your micro:bit.

# Instructions
The program will display its version on startup. Leave as is to recieve messages.

To enter Send mode, press A. Messages are typed using Morse code, A being dot(.) and B being dash(-).

To confirm your letter, press A+B. The letter will be displayed. Keep doing this for each letter.

When you're done, press A+B again to send your message. Any micro:bits running the same program will recieve your message and display it on the screen.
